The intent of this project is to demonstrate a non-invasive water flow detection solution capturing the variations in the vibrations on the pipe during the flow. 

Solution components: 
1.	Microcontroller with 6-Axis IMU (https://shop.m5stack.com/collections/m5-core/products/m5stickc-plus-esp32-pico-mini-iot-development-kit )
2.	ML Algorithm to classify the flow detection using IBM Cloud
3.	Node-red Dashboard
