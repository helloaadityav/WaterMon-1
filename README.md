# WaterMon


WaterMon is an endeavour to create smart solutions for water resource management and water sanitation problems. Factors related to water managment, sanitation, and hygiene affect humans in many ways. According to UNICEF WASH, 400 million school-aged children a year are infected by intestinal worms, which sap their learning abilities. 

We at WaterMon beileve that using technology to automate water managment and sanitation systems will enable better usage of water. The aim is to create solutions that are affordable, automated, efficient and sustainable.

The method is designed to be crowd-sourced and handled by a local communities to create a global impact enabling them to be stakeholders in environmental management.

We encourage all to build on these solutions, contribute to creating innovative solutions.
