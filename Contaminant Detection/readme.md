Portable Water Test Kits based on waterborne hydrogen sulfide (H2S) indicator bacteria for
carrying out the bacteriological examination of drinking water for the presence of fecal coliform
are available at an economical price. The results from these kits are inferred based on visual
indicators such as colour change over long periods [24-48 hours]. The results vary based on
environmental factors such as temperature.

Portable Water Test Kits although functional, economical are cumbersome to use. Also there is
no standard co-relation of the data from various tests to generate actionable insights. E.g.
Water Quality tests for a specific region.

Project WaterMon: Fix impediments for effective utilisation of Water Test Kits. The method is
designed using easily available components and analytics framework to be crowd-sourced. It
can be handled by groups such as school students, enabling them to be stakeholders in
environmental management.

Solution Overview:
• IoT Model: Automated Water Testing device is built with a microcontroller, sensor
components to function with the readily available manual Water Testing Kits. The
device is connected to the cloud for reports and data correlation.
• ML-based Analytical method: To estimate drinking-water quality, co-relate data from
different sources to generate insights for actions.
